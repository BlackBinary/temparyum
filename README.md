# Temparyum

Temparyum is a secure, efficient, and lightweight peer-to-peer (P2P) network for transferring funds, executing smart contracts, and transmitting data with a focus on maintaining privacy and scalability. Built to overcome the limitations of traditional blockchain networks, Temparyum offers a unique approach to digital financial networks through the use of temporary and permanent addresses, file-based funds management, and the distributed verification system.

## Features

- **Transfer of Temparyum**: Securely and efficiently transfer funds over the P2P network using file-based representation of funds.
- **Temporary and Permanent Addresses**: Enhance user privacy and security with temporary and permanent addresses.
- **Lightweight Smart Contract Functionality**: Execute smart contracts without the burden of traditional blockchain networks.
- **Double Spend Prevention**: Ensure unique transactions with a chain that is not linked to an address.
- **Distributed Verification System**: Decentralize verification tasks through consensus algorithms and node-based rewards.
- **Secure and Private Data Transmission**: Split sent messages into parts and verify with separate nodes for enhanced privacy.
- **Fee Distribution**: Incentivize nodes with a portion of transaction fees based on message weight.
